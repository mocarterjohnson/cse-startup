hi there

What does HTML stand for? What is it?
  Hyper Text Markup Language. Its a coding language that is used to make web pages

  <html>
    <head>
      <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
  </html>
What are heading tags used for?
  They are used to differenciate text by bolding it or making it a different size than the regular paragraph text
How do you create a list of items on the page?
  You first have to choose whether it is an ordered or unordered list and use those tags (<ol> or <ul>) then inside that include 
  list items <li> that are the content
How do you create a hyperlink to another webpage?
    <a href = https:link.com>Words displayed on the web page that you can click on that will take you to said link</a>
How do you add an image to a webpage? What is the importance of the alt tag?
    You add an image using the self-closing element of <img/> that is linked to a picture that is already hosted online. 
    The alt tage names the picture so if it doesn't load the user still knows what it is supposed to be a picture of. It alsomakes it 
    so screen readers can "read" the image
What does a comment look like in HTML?
    <!-- Comment content -->
What does CSS stand for? What is it?
    Cascading Style Sheets. Its the language used to modify html to make it actually look good and have different colors, fonts, etc.
Why do we want to put stylings in a separate CSS file instead of in the html head?
    It seperates the two and gives them distinct areas where they should be. It makes it so the code is easier to read and so that the
    html file isn't super long and complicated. Overall creates better workflow. You can also link one style sheet to multiple html
    pages so you don't have to rewrite code.
How do you link a CSS file to an HTML file?
    Use <link> in the head tag and make sure to set he type to "text/css" and the rel to "stylesheet"
What is the anatomy of a CSS declaration?
    The declaration is inside the tag that you want to modify (selector) and includes the part you want to change (property) and what 
    you want to change it to (value)
How do you assign two html elements the same properties at the same time?
    You can just put a comma between the two elements when making them selectors and then declaring everything else the same way
What are some best practices for writing CSS code?
    Try to start with the most broad selector at the top so you can overwrite other smaller tags and sections. Make sure to indent 
    correctly. 
What does a comment look like in CSS?
    /* Comments in CSS are exactly like multi-line comments in Java */
What property do you change to set the text color of an element? What about the background color?
    You change the "color" property for the text color and the "background-color" for the background
What is a named color and where can you find a list of them?\
    A named color is a color that can be called just by writing its keyword instead of using a hexadecimal or RGB values. 
    There is a list of them online @ http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/
How many possible colors are there using RGB?
    16,777,216
Why must we sometimes include redundant color options in our CSS code?
    That way our code can be used by different browsers and they will be supported no matter what even if a certain browser doesn't 
    support a certain delcaration, it will most likely support one of the others put in place.
